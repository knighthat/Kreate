What changes is that, naturally, it will not be playable, play the skip song it's the user's decision.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThis idea was added by Luxxx on Discord, they don't have a github account\n\n<img width=\"416\" height=\"924\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e7da7c-d86e-43ad-8197-c42d050f263b\" />",
