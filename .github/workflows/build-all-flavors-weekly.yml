            ## ðŸ“² Installation
  
            Download and install `minified` version of the app (because the size is smaller).\
            Only install `full` version when `minified` exhibits problems during installation.\
            If you have trouble using the app, report it with the link below.
            
            > **If Android says that data will be wiped, cancel and report it [HERE](https://github.com/knighthat/Kreate/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yaml)**

            ## What's the difference between `Kreate-minified.apk` and `Kreate-full.apk`

            No difference.

            `minified` version strips unused code at compile time, making the APK smaller to download.
            `full` version is still uploaded to help people who have trouble installing `minified` version.

            > [This article](https://kreate.knighthat.me/usr/faq/minified_and_full) explains this matter in detail.
            
            ## What's `Kreate-izzy.apk`
            
            This is APK built specifically for IzzyOnDroid with update checker disabled. You shouldn't
            download this version here.
            
            ## Verification
            
            > Always check for signature before installing any app you downloaded from Github or any other APK distributors.\
