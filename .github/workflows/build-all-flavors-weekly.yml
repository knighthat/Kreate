            ## ATTENTION
            
            Since **January 5th, 2025**, KBuild is split into 2 main flavors, **_upstream_** and **_improvised_**.
            The main different is **_upstream_** contains the most up-to-date code to the actual [RiMusic](https://github.com/fast4x/RiMusic)
            repository while **_improvised_** offers more performance with custom code, in return, it require
            significant more time to finish.
            
            ## 📲 Installation
            
            This version is signed by (@knighthat). Android treats this build as if this is a different app, thus,
            your old RiMusic app will not be removed nor its data will be wiped.
            
            > Help! I install your build before Jan 5th, which version should I download now?
            > **_improvised_** is your updated version. Download _minified_ or _full_ as you see fit.
            > Your app will be updated normally without losing any data in the process.
            > 
            > **If Android says that data will be wiped, cancel and report it [HERE](https://github.com/knighthat/RiMusic/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yaml)**
            
            ## Verification
            
            > Always check for signature before installing any app you downloaded from Github or any other APK distributor.
