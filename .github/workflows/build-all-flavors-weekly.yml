            ## ATTENTION
            
            **NEW**: This is the final update for old Kreate upstream and improvised. New version of Kreate
            is now a standalone app, with its own identity.
            
            ### If you're on old Kreate
            
            Continue to download your flavor (upstream or improvise) to unlock button to export your data
            to a file for migration
            
            ### If you're a new user
            
            Please download `Kreate-full.apk` or `Kreate-minified.apk` according to your preference 
            (`minified` version offers smaller size without any loss, only install `full` if you have 
            troubles with `minified` version)
            
            ### How to migrate

            Install new Kreate (don't worry, it won't override your data) then **Settings** > **Data** > **Import migration file**.
            
            Or, visit [document](https://kreate.knighthat.me/usr/how-to-migrate) for demonstrations
            
            ## ðŸ“² Installation
            
            This version is signed by (@knighthat). Android treats this build as if this is a different app, thus,
            your old RiMusic app will not be removed nor its data will be wiped.
            
            > Help! I install your build before Jan 5th, which version should I download now?
            > **_improvised_** is your updated version. Download _minified_ or _full_ as you see fit.
            > Your app will be updated normally without losing any data in the process.
            > 
            > **If Android says that data will be wiped, cancel and report it [HERE](https://github.com/knighthat/Kreate/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yaml)**
            
            ## Verification
            
            > Always check for signature before installing any app you downloaded from Github or any other APK distributors.
