      # - Show all files that were changed withing 48 hrs.
      # - Show changed file paths in relative (composeApp/androidMain, etc.)

      # grep -q "^composeApp/androidImprovised/" && echo "true" || echo "false"

      # - composeApp/commonMain
      # - .gradle, .gradle.kts, or gradle-wrapper.properties
